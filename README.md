# Apply for Legal Aid Prototype

Make sure you have Node.js v14.x installed locally. Further information on the requirements can be found here:
https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/install/requirements.md . You can follow this guide but once you get to
the 'Install the kit' step then you should come back here and download/clone this prototype rather than the
example GOV.UK one. Then you can continue following the instructions in the guide.

Once you have the requirements set up and this prototype downloaded onto your machine, run `npm install` on the command line.

To start the prototype, run `npm start`.

The guide here https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs also provides examples and further information.

## Deploying to Cloud platform

A github action is set up for this prototype so that every time someone pushes to the master branch, this triggers an automatic deployment of the master branch to the Cloud platform. Therefore, you do not need to do anything other than push your
code to master or merge your branch into the master branch, and it will deploy automatically.
