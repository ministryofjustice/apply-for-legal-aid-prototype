# Apply for Legal Aid Prototype

Make sure you have Node.js v18.x installed locally.

To start the prototype, run `npm start`.

## Deploying to Cloud platform

A github action is set up for this prototype so that every time someone pushes to the master branch, this triggers an automatic deployment of the master branch to the Cloud platform. Therefore, you do not need to do anything other than push your
code to master or merge your branch into the master branch, and it will deploy automatically.
