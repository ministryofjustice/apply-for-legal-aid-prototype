    The proportionality test checks if the costs of a case are fair compared to the value it brings.

      It is judged by:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <br>
      <li>how much money is at stake</li>
      <li>value of non-monetary outcomes</li>
      <li>wider factors, like public importance or reputation</li>
      </ul>
<br>
      The test is met if:
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <br>
      <li>for damage claims, the ratio of damages to costs is reasonable</li>
      <li>for non-damage claims, the costs are fair in relation to how important or significant the outcome is</li>
      </ul>
<br>
      If the case is not cost-effective, it considers:
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <br>
      <li>the seriousness of the issues raised if they are significant enough to justify the costs</li>
      <li>if someone would be willing or able to pay for the case themselves</li>
