<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">What data we collect</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">The data we collect from you includes:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<p class="govuk-body">We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use the service.</p>

<li>how you got to the service</li>
<li>what you click on while you’re using the service</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">We do not collect or store your personal information through Google Analytics (for example your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.</p>

<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Why we need your data</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">We collect data to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<li>gather statistics about the service</li>
<li>help us monitor and improve the service</li>
<li>prevent or detect crime or fraud</li>
<li>justify public expenditure</li>
<li>carry out audits to ensure that the decisions we make are correct and accurate</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">The legal basis for processing your personal data is the result of the powers contained in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/10/contents/enacted">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012</a>.</p>

<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do with your data</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">We’ll share your personal data with your solicitor so they can complete your legal aid application.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We may also share your data with:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>other government departments, agencies and public bodies</li>
<li>non-public organisations such as credit reference and debt collection agencies</li>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
<li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">We will share your data if the law requires us to – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Where your data is processed and stored</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at all stages, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">All personal data is stored in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea">European Economic Area</a> (EEA). Google Analytics data may be transferred outside the EEA, but this cannot be used to personally identify you.</p>

<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">How we protect your data and keep it secure</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.</p>

<h1 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your data</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">We will only retain your personal data for as long as:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>it is needed for the purposes set out in this document</li>
